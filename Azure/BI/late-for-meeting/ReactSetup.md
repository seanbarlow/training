# React Setup

If you are not familiar with React then you can get more information from the React site [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)

I used the create-react-app generator for this project. You will need to install node.js before you can install the generator.

To install the create-react-app generator, in a terminal or command prompt type:

```bash
npm install -g late-for-meeting-app
```

This may take a few minutes to install. You can now create a new React application by typing:

```bash
create-react-app late-for-meeting-app
```

where late-for-meeting-app is the name of the folder for your application. This may take a few minutes to create the React application and install its dependencies.

Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

```bash
cd late-for-meeting-app
npm start
```

You should see "Welcome to React" on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with VS Code.

To open your React application in VS Code, open another terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the late-for-meeting-app folder and type code .:

```bash
cd late-for-meeting-app
code .
```

If VS Code fails to open then you may need to install the tools. [VS Code CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line)
